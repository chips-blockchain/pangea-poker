# Pange Poker GUI Refresh (WIP)

## Run the project

`npm install` and `npm start` for the front-end.

You will need to run your own back-end nodes. [Here](https://github.com/NOCTLJRNE/CHIPS-tuto/blob/master/README.md) is a detailed guide on how to do it.

Once you've set up the back-end nodes, change the IP addresses in `Game.jsx` to connect to all four nodes.
