# CHIPS Poker Frontend

This is a redesign of [Pangea Poker Frontend](https://github.com/sg777/pangea-poker-frontend). Built with React, currently in WIP.

## Run the project

Run `npm install` and `npm start` in the root folder

You will need to run your own back-end nodes. [Here](https://github.com/NOCTLJRNE/CHIPS-tuto/blob/master/README.md) is a detailed guide on how to do it.

Once you've set up the back-end nodes, enter the node IPs at the startup modal to start playing.
